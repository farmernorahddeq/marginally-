# marginally-
seems to be depending on number of lines in the file 100 lines then original is faster 1000 lines then about 30% faster 10000 lines then twice as fast original also deals only with @CRLF so should not be an issue one way of getting the newline type to see which character(s) it is   Local $tArray = StringRegExp($sData, "(.*\R)", $STR_REGEXPARRAYMATCH)     If (@error = 0) Then ;~  Determine linetype to be CRLF of LF or CR         Local $newLine = (StringRight($tArray[0], 2) = @CRLF) ? @CRLF : StringRight($tArray[0], 1)     Else         Return SetError(8, 0, 0)     EndIf    We are still in range of milliseconds so although good to know when you have to deal with text files frequently   I tried with stringregex but then after dealing with files > 5000 lines memory problems occur / errors anyway its with regex only marginally faster then original (about 20%) Local $sRegExPattern = "((.*\R){" &amp; ($iLine - 1) &amp; "})(.*)((.*\R){1,})(.*)"
